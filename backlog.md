# ideas for features and additions

* Textures for simulation instead of just colored cells
* Map should only render what is in view
* Surface Tiles should be renamed to surface objects. -> There should be able to be multiple surface tiles on top of a single map tile. Keep map tiles though for dom size rendering. I still feel like having a grid map made up of chunks is a good idea.
* push to github pages
