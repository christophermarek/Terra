# Health & Game Console

I want to implement an eating system for the animals but first I have to implement some things before.

What I can think of so far:
* Health 
* Plant regeneration
* Combat (For carnivores)
* Eating from plants 

I also want a better display to visualize what is happening in the world.

## Health

The changes I need to make to implement a health system is:
* Give every surfaceObject a health property
* Create functions to lower or raise health
* Implement a dying action to remove dead surfaceObjects from the game
