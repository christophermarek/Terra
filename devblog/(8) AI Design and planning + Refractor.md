# (8) AI Design

I finally organized my files more. Now most of the logic is out of the Simulation.js file which is good because I only want that to focus on rendering the page.

## AI design

The ai system needs a more concrete design. I wanted to do a POC first, and now that I understand how it can be implemented I can design it properly.

I think I need to design a behavior tree system and there will be general behaviors and animal specific behaviors.

Scoring system too
